# Codequiz
For this activity I created a quiz that asked questions related to what we have learned so far in this course.
This quiz is time limited and will deduct time from the total if the user answers a question incorrectly.
This quiz ends when the timer reaches 0 or if the user has answered all the questions.
The quiz offers a score to the user at the end and records the user's score at the end.
The score is then saved to the user's database and the user may choose to take the quiz again.
If the user scores a different score then that score will also be recorded with the highest score being recorded first.
Each question answered wrong deducts 15 seconds off the clock with the alotted time of 56 seconds.
The user has 3-5 answers to choose from for each question.
This quiz includes multiple js and html files with one css file.
